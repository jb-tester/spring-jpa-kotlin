In the entity class all the columns defined as class constructor parameters are reported as never used
(unless they are implicitly accessed via get/set)

Uncomment the fields accessing in the `com.mytests.spring.springjpakotlin.PopulateDBService` class to get rid of the
`property is never used` error in the entity class `com.mytests.spring.springjpakotlin.EmployeeTbl`.
